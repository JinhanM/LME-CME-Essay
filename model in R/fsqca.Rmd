## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data12 = read.csv('2007.csv',1)
# data12 = subset(data12,Year == 2012)
data12 = data12[,-c(1,2)]
data12 = data12[which(data12$Country.Type != 0),]
data12$Country.Type[data12$Country.Type == -1] = 0
data12[,c(4:15)] = invlogit(data12[,c(4:15)])
data12[,c(4:15)] = round(data12[,c(4:15)],digits = 2)
data12 = t(data12)

write.csv(data12,'data12.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
i = 17
data12 = read.csv('2007.csv',1)


temp = data.matrix(data12[i])

temp[7]
(temp[7]+temp[16])/2
temp[16]
cx <- calibrate(temp, thresholds = "e=9.5, c= 9.952862, i=10.40572")

data12[i] = as.data.frame(cx)

write.csv(data12,'2007.csv')

plot(temp, cx, main="Binary crisp set using 1 threshold",
xlab = "Raw data", ylab = "Calibrated data", yaxt="n")
axis(2, at = 0:1)
#data12[,c(16)] = calibrate(data12[4], type="fuzzy")
```
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 175, sd = 10)
class(x)
cx <- calibrate(x, thresholds = "e=165, c=175, i=185")
plot(x, cx, main="Binary crisp set using 1 threshold",
xlab = "Raw data", ylab = "Calibrated data", yaxt="n")
axis(2, at = 0:1)
```
```{r}
runGUI()
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
